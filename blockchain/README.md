Intro

This blockchain is actually a fake blockchain.

How to run the program
----------------------
You can either run the file `BCInterface.java`, or run one of the tests in `test` directory.

### Dependencies
* For the interface, you will need to compile the file with the swing library.
* You have the possibility to save a block or a transaction in a json file, you will need the gson library if you want to try that.
