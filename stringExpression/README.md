# Calculation of a string expression

Intro
-----
An algorithm we did to train on basic data structures, as stacks and queues
, that calculates the exact result of an expression represented with a string.

How to compile
--------------
- This code is in C language, so you just have to get in the `src` directory and type the command `make` so it will compile
and create an executable file in the same directory. 
- You will need an argument to run this file, you have an example : `test/example.txt`
So you can run it with the command `./expr test/example.txt`
and the program will show you all the process of calculating each formulas in the file.

Features
--------
- Github didn't allow me to give you the documentation I have, in case you want to use the stack or whatever.
	- If you want a doc, just type `make doc` and a new documentation directory will appear, find the file `index.html`, open it, here you are !
- You can create your own test files, but be careful it can't calculate every possible formulas.
	- Use only `*`, `+`, `-`, `/`, `^`, `(` or `)`.

###### Enjoy !
